# Project Template

This is the bare bones template for our projects.

To use it
 1. Make a new empty project repository with appropriate name on github
 2. Clone the new project repo to your local machine
 3. Clone **this** template repository to your local machine
 4. Copy everything from this template repository (except the .git directory) to the directory containing the new blank project repository. For example, you can use the following command at the unix/mac/bash shell command line `rsync -auvzr --exclude='.git/' * ../mynewproject` if you are already in the ProjectTemplate directory.
 5. From within the new project repository add, commit and push everything back to github. (or edit stuff first and then add, commit, and push).
 6. Change names of files:
    1. Change name of the .Rproj file.
    2. Make other changes.
 7. Now delete all of the text in this Project Template section. The README.md should begin with the following.


# NAME OF PROJECT

This is the github repository for THE PROJECT.
