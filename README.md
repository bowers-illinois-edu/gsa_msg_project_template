# ProjectTemplate
This is the bare bones template for our projects.

To use it
 1. Make a new empty project repository with appropriate name on github
 2. Clone the new project repo to your local machine
 3. Clone **this** template repository to your local machine
 4. Copy everything from this template repository (except the .git directory) to the directory containing the new blank project repository.
 5. From within the new project repository add, commit and push everything back to github. (or edit stuff first and then add, commit, and push).
